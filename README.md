# HTTP Educational Website

## Overview

This static website teaches high‑school students about the HTTP protocol. It covers:

- What HTTP and HTTPS are  
- How a web page is downloaded (HTTP trace analysis)  
- The format and components of an HTTP request  
- When to use GET vs. POST  

The site is built with hand‑written HTML and CSS to demonstrate core web development concepts, including responsive image handling.

## Requirements

- Plain HTML and CSS (no autogenerated code or frameworks)  
- Proper file and folder organization  
- External stylesheet (`style.css`) linked from every page  
- Responsive design for images (three size variants)

- **Navigation**: Each page includes a `<div id="nav">` with links to all pages.  
- **Content area**: Wrapped in `<div id="content">`.  

## HTML Features Used

- Headings (`<h1>`, `<h2>`)  
- Paragraphs (`<p>`)  
- `<div>` sections for layout  
- Ordered (`<ol>`) and unordered lists (`<ul>`)  
- `<table>` for structured data  
- `<span>` for inline styling  
- `<picture>` + `<source>` for responsive images  

## CSS Features Used

- CSS Grid layout  
- Descendant selectors (e.g., `element1 element2`)  
- Child selectors (e.g., `element1 > element2`)  
- Media queries to select responsive image variants  

## Responsive Images

Each `<picture>` element includes three `<source>` tags:

- **Small** (max-width: 1000px)  
- **Medium** (max-width: 1499px)  
- **Large** (min-width: 1500px)  

The browser picks the appropriate image based on viewport width.
