            <h2>When to use GET:</h2>
            <p class="text">Imagine you're browsing the web. When you click on a link or type a website's address, your browser is using a GET request. You use GET when you just want to look at something, like reading an article or seeing pictures on a webpage. It's like asking for information without changing anything.

                GET is also like a search query. When you look for something on a search engine, you're using a GET request. It's like asking the search engine to find stuff for you. GET requests are good for when you're reading or searching, and they're safe because they don't change things on the website.</p>
            <h2>When to use POST:</h2>
            <p class="text">Now, imagine you're filling out a form on a website. When you hit the "Submit" button, your information is sent to the website using a POST request. You use POST when you want to send something to the website and make a change. It's like sending a message that says, "Hey, I want to add this new thing" or "Please update this information for me."

                POST is useful when you're doing something that changes stuff on the website, like creating a new account, leaving a comment, or uploading a picture. It's like you're telling the website to do something special with the data you're sending.</p>

        </div>
        
        <h2 style="padding: 100px; font-weight: 100;">The best way to think of it is, GET is for reading, and POST is for making changes. Choosing the right one helps you interact with websites in the right way!</h2>
