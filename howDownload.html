                <p class="text">When you visit a webpage, several steps occur in the background to download and display its content. Here's a simplified explanation of the sequence of HTTP requests:</p>
                
                <!-- Ordered List -->
                <ol class="text">
                    <li>When you open a webpage, your web browser sends an HTTP request to the web server.</li>
                    <li>The server sends back the main content of the page (HTML) in an HTTP response.</li>
                    <li>Your browser checks if there are other things needed, like pictures, styles, or special features (JavaScript).</li>
                    <li>If there are, your browser sends more HTTP requests for those things.</li>
                    <li>The server responds by sending the requested stuff in HTTP responses.</li>
                    <li>Your browser puts all the pieces together and shows you the complete webpage.</li>
                    <li>As you interact with the page, like clicking on links or buttons, your browser might send more requests to get new information.</li>
                    <li>This way, you can see and use all the different parts of the webpage.</li>
                </ol>

                <p class="text">The sequence of HTTP requests and responses continues as you interact with the webpage, fetching new content or data as needed. This process allows you to browse and enjoy the dynamic and interactive nature of modern websites.</p>
