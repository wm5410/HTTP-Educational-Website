            <h2>Format of a HTTP request</h2>
            <p class="text">Think of an HTTP request as a message that your computer sends to a website when you want to see a webpage or do something on that site. This message has a specific structure:</p>
            
            <ol class="text">
                <li>Start Line: Imagine this as the main heading of your message. It says what you want and where you want it from.</li>
                <li>Details: Think of these as extra notes you attach to your message to give more information.</li>
                <li>Extras (Optional): These are like optional attachments you add to your message.</li>
                <li>Extra Information (Optional): Sometimes you need to provide more details about what you want to do. This is like adding more pages to your message.</li>
            </ol>
            
            <p class="text">And that's it! An easy way to visualise this is the image below.</p>
